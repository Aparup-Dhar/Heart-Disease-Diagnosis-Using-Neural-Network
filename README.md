# Title
Heart Disease Diagnosis Using Neural Network

# Description
The diagnosis of heart diseases is a critical and complex task in the medical field, requiring
accurate analysis of patient health data. With the increasing availability of large-scale health
data, there is a growing interest in developing machine learning models, particularly neural
networks, for multiclass classification problems in heart disease diagnosis.
